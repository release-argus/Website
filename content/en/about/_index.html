Argus (named after the hundred-eyed giant in Greek mythology) was developed to help me stay on the latest releases.Rather than scheduling
AWX jobs every week for instance, there was a desire to have them run only when there is a change
to be made. So, Argus was developed to solve this want. It alerts and actions
the new releases, all while providing a UI to see what it's tracking.

Visit our [documentation](../docs) to find out more, or visit the [demo](../demo/approvals) to see it in action!
