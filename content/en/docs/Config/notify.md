  Configure global notifiers that can be used by any Service.

We are running [Shoutrrr 0.8](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/v0.8/services/overview/), which supports sending notifications to the services listed below.

The 'URL Fields' go under `url_fields` and 'Query/Param Props' go under `params`.

Below I have used capitals in some key naming for better readability (ignore that Argus will convert that to lower-case as it shouldn't break anything).

The lines prefixed with a # are optional vars that aren't required.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Environment variables in the format '${ENV_VAR}' can be used in the `options.*`, `params.*` and `url_fields.*` fields.
{{< /alert >}}

The config for each of these is laid out in the format of
```yaml
notify:
  ...
  # As many of these (below) as you like, just ensure they have unique ID's
  EXAMPLE_NOTIFY_ID:
    type: shoutrrr
    options:
#     delay: AhBmCs                             # Time to wait when a new release is found before sending this message
#     max_tries: 3                              # Maximum number of times to try sending this message until a send is successful
#     message: >-                               # Message template
#       <{{ service_url }}|{{ service_id }}> -
#       {{ version }} released{% if web_url %}
#       (<{{ web_url }}|changelog>){% endif %}
    url_fields: {}
    params: {}
```
where the vars available in `options` stay the same every time (so they'll be omitted below).

#### message templating

The `message` used in the Notify messages can be customised with Django-style templating courtesy of [pongo2](https://www.schlachter.tech/solutions/pongo2-template-engine/).

The default message template is
`<{{ service_url }}|{{ service_id }}> - {{ version }} released{% if web_url %} (<{{ web_url }}|changelog>){% endif %}`
, which with a `service_id` of 'example_service', a `service_url` of 'example.com', no `web_url` and the `version` that triggered
this message being '1.2.3', would trigger a message of `example_service - 1.2.3 released` (example_service would be a clickable link to the service_url). If the Service had a `web_url` defined, then ' (changelog)' would appear at the end, where the 'changelog' text would be a clickable link to that `web_url`.

The vars that can be used in both the title and message templates are:
- service_id
- service_url
- web_url
- version

The default Slack message format assumes that when `web_url` is defined, it is a link to the services changelog. Then, in any notifications by Argus about that service,
you should get a clickable 'changelog' button that takes you to that `web_url`.


For further guidance and other helpful examples on the templating used, start by looking [here](/docs/help/templating).

Either a Webhook, or the Slack Bot API can be used.

To get a token for a Bot:
- Create an App for your bot with Slacks '[Creating an app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating)' guide.
- Install the App into your workspace ([Slack docs](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing)).
- From [Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), select your App and go to 'OAuth & Permissions'
- Copy the 'Bot User OAuth Token'
- e.g. `xoxb:012345678901-0123456789012-phq24qfrhqnm2mtmz54dwkop

To use Webhooks:
- Create an App for your bot with Slacks '[Creating an app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating)' guide.
- Enable incoming Webhooks for that app ([Slack docs](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#enable_webhooks))
- Create an incoming Webhook ([Slack docs](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#create_a_webhook))
- e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- becomes 'hook:T00000000-B00000000-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

- To get a token, [talk to the botfather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).
- Chats
    - `@channel-name` can only be used for public channels. The name can be found by going to `Channel info`, just replace the `t.me/` prefix with an `@`.
    - `chat_id` is required for private channels/group chats/private chats. To get the ID, you can forward a message (from the target chat) to [@UserInfoBot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or [@JsonDumpBot](https://t.me/jsondumpbot) and view it at `Id` and `message.forward_from_chat.id` from those bots respectively.
    - (The above bots are created and hosted by [@nadam](https://github.com/nadam) and their sources are available to view at [nadam/userinfobot](https://github.com/nadam/userinfobot) and [nadam/jsondumpbot](https://github.com/nadam/jsondumpbot))
